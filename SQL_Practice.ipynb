It's important to remember that everything in a database is a `set` meaning that there is no inherent order in how it is stored. If we simply `SELECT` from our database we have to assume that the values are returned in a random order. However, we can use `ORDER BY` statement to specify the order we want. In the following cell, retrieve all the values in your database first by the `Model` attribute, then the `City MPG`, `Hwy MPG`, and `Cmb MPG` attributes. Print the result to the console."
